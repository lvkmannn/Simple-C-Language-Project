# Simple-C-Language-Project
Two simple C language projects for beginners

There are 2 scenarios for each project:

1. First Scenario: Rent A Van wants a program that calculates the total cost of renting a van. Customers pay a base fee plus a charge per mile driven. RM700 is the base fee, and the charge per mile is based on the table below. Request the input from the user. If value entered is not positive, ask user to re-enter the correct value and display text message. You also need to use and apply basic loop structure.
